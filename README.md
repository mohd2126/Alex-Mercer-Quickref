Info
===

This is a quick reference for 5e that includes Alex Mercer's Homebrew.
[C] stands for changed, the change could be to the whole thing or part of it, [N] stands for new
AlMe stands for Alex Mercer (not Aluminum Methyl :p), it'll mostly be used in stuff that was partially changed to differentiate between vanilla and the changes.
Abilities that can be used by either an Action or a Bonus Action were placed with Bonus Actions
This is meant to help you remember the rules, do not use it to argue them with the DM.
